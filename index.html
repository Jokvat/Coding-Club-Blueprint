                <h3>Club Vision:</h3>
                <p>
                    The vision for the Coding Club is to connect high school students who
                    have an interest in learning to program, and to use those connections
                    to build a welcoming community in which everyone strengthens each
                    others' coding skills. It would be accessible to anyone with any skill 
                    level—whether they haven't written a single line of code, or they
                    designed and programmed an entire video game; however, the primary focus
                    is to introduce beginners into the world of coding using web development,
                    as there are many free and wonderful resources available. Although the
                    focus is on beginners, anyone with experience who may  be interested in 
                    a programming community are encouraged to join for opportunities to gain
                    leadership experience, engage with fellow members who share the same
                    passion, and to help others with their interest in coding; as it is said,
                    teaching <em>is</em> the best way to learn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning to program can seem like a very daunting process, and it is easy
                    to get overwhelmed with the vast amounts of information available on the 
                    internet. Having an encouraging community that strives to help each other,
                    and a sense of direction are both important factors that contribute to
                    learning, all of which would be provided by the Coding Club.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Additionally, hosting events—taking place online or in person—is another
                    goal for the club. These events could further introduce students of any
                    age to discover that they <em>can</em> build these "intimidating"
                    programming skills.
                </p>

            <div class="resources section">
                <h3>Resources:</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe following a similar style to a book club, where a
                    certain portion of a chosen resource (Book/Course/Curriculum) is
                    assigned before each club session. This allows for more time during
                    club meetings to discuss, and work on fun, hands-on projects. I don't 
                    wish for the club to become another "chore" or "class," so nothing
                    would be too heavy, especially considering the fact that everyone has
                    their academics to prioritize.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some resources that could be used for this "book club" style of learning:

                        - I personally have been following the Odin Project's curriculum
                        for a few months now, and I have been really enjoying it.

                        There are many more resources available, but these are
                        some that I have found to be the most popular.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="considerations section">
                <h3>Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    A main concern of mine was how the club would be run, specifically addressing the
                    session system. I wanted to consider any new members that may join, in addition to
                    any returning members, and I did not want them to feel lost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An idea was proposed to me, however, that there should be additional breakout
                    rooms at the beginning of every session, allowing new club members to not
                    be left out. I thought that the idea was wonderful, and I believe it could be a
                    perfect fit for the Coding Club.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="communication section">
                <h3>Communication</h3>
                <p>
                    Meetings could be held via Google Meet or Zoom, as they are the most 
                    commonly used online meeting applications. Also, the club could utilize
                    platforms including Discord or Slack to communicate outside of club 
                    meetings, including asking for help or guidance and searching for
                    additional resources.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="collaboration section">
                <h3>Collaboration:</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaboration is important when learning how to program, and I have 
                    researched and gathered some resources that can contribute to this
                    key aspect of coding:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> 
                    <a href="https://github.com/apps/desktop" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
                    target="_blank">GitHub</a> 
                        - Web platform that allows collaboration and 
                        sharing of code using Git, a version control system.
                    </li>

                    <li> 
                        <a href="https://glitch.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
                        target="_blank">Glitch</a> 
                        - Web platform used for collaboratively building web applications
                        with real time updates.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://codesandbox.io/?from-app=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
                        target="_blank">CodeSandbox</a> 
                        - "Code sandbox gives you 24/7 collaborative cloud development
                        environments that resume in 2 seconds." Includes sandboxes allowing
                        for secure, shareable code.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://codepen.io/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
                        target="_blank">Code Pen</a>
                        - Code pen's collaborative mode is locked behind a subscription, however I 
                        included because it is still great for testing out web development.
                    </li>

                    <li>Once again, there are many more platforms and applications available</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="extra section">
                <h3>Extra:</h3>

                <p>
                    I also have a couple ideas that could be potentially implemented: 
                    guest speakers, and session projects. Guest speakers would be a 
                    beneficial addition to the club meetings, helping showcase how 
                    programming can be applied in various professions, and inspiration 
                    as well. Regarding the session projects, each activity done in every 
                    meeting could be a smaller part of an overall project, slowly sticking 
                    each piece together. Instead of discarding the small tasks that would 
                    be completed each meeting, putting them all together to form a working 
                    website, for example, would give a sense of accomplishment. 
                    Additionally, all the activities completed in each meeting would be 
                    put to use, giving purpose to them, rather than just throwing them away.
                     Overall, I believe both additions would be great to include.
